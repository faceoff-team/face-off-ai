Facial Recognition Tests: Manual (covers AC 3-5)

Input: Webcam data including a face

Test 1 (AC 3, 5):
Expected output: a square bounding box around a human face
Procedure:
1. Navigate to face-off-ai home directory
2. Run pipenv run python facial_recognition/facial_recognition.py
3. When video loads, observe bounding boxes around faces (if there is no bounding box, fail)
4. Move face back and forth across screen, never allowing any part of the face to Move
off of the screen (if a bounding box drops, fail).
5. Move face off of screen. Bounding box should disappear (if box persists, fail)


Test 2 (AC 2):
Expected output: real-time ML labels on emotion
Procedure:
1. Navigate to face-off-ai home directory
2. Run pipenv run python facial_recognition/facial_recognition.py
3. When video loads, observe real-time labels appearing in the terminal.
4. Change facial expressions from happy to sad to ensure that labels change
accordingly (if no labels change, fail.)
5. Start a clock and time delta between labels being processed (if > 1 second, fail.)
