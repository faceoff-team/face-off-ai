Testing transform script: Manual process.

Input: a directory of normal images with facial data.

Expected output: A directory of cropped image with facial landmarks. If one includes non-facial data, it will not be transformed.

Procedure:
1. Identify source and destination folders
2. Navigate to home directory of face-off-ai
3. Run command "pipenv run python model/scripts/transform.py --src <full_path_to_source_dir> --dst <full_path_to_destination_dir>"
4. Observe each file in the destination folder. Each folder should be cropped, resized, and covered in facial landmarks. No
undesirable images should be in the destination folder.

NOTE: This test also fulfills AC 4 for story 37, as it shows that inanimate objects will be discluded from the dataset used for testing.
