Dataset tests: Manual Testing:

Test 1 (AC 2,3):
input: Dataset
Expected output: Image count
Procedure:
1. Enter the directory model/modified_data/train
2. Observe the folders of data. If there are any stray images outside of the
image classes (folders), then fail. Furthermore, if the train folder has no
organized image class lists at all, then fail.

Test 2 (AC 5):
input: Dataset
Expected output: A reasonable distribution of race and gender amongst images
Procedure:
1. Enter the directory model/modified_data/train. You may also enter model/data/train if you like,
as it can be more difficult to observe the resized/modified images for gender/race.
2. Choose 10 (100 for a more robust test) images at random from the set.
3. Observe the race of each image as best as possible. If 80% of the images are the same race, then
Fail.
4. Observe the gender of each image as best as possible. If 80% of the images are the same gender, then
Fail.
